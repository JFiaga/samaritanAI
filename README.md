## Project Details

# ðŸ“Œ SamaritanAI is a PaaS that allows you to generate images, videos, sound, code and text according to your needs, with a beautiful and intuitive interface.
# ðŸ“Œ SamaritanAI is the project I most enjoyed working on, as I'm a big fan of artificial intelligence. 
# ðŸ“Œ Its realization was relatively simple, thanks to the experience of my previous projects. 
# ðŸ“Œ However, I learned a few new tricks in its design, notably the Prisma ORM, which I find very efficient and easy to use, and the integration of stripe to give privileges to a user depending on whether he pays or not.
